## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Docker

Docker installation is required, see the official [installation docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

First step is to build the environment and install Node.js (or anything elseâ€¦) before rebuilding the complete environment :

```Sh
docker-compose build
```

Afterwards building is only necessary when installing new dependencies.

######  Linux specific

From host, to 'get ownership back' for the generated files, this command finds all files owned by root in the current directory and chown them back to `given_user`:
(Postgres directory will stay own by root, this is normal !)

```bash
find . -user root | xargs sudo chown given_user:given_user
```

#### Environment variables

Environment variables are managed with `.env` file. Add your own configuration to this file according to `.env.sample` file

Everything is set up. You can now start using the application using :

```sh
docker-compose up
```

You can access to the app at : http://localhost
